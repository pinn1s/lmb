# Contributing to LMB

Thank you for being so interested in contributing to LMB. Whether you've found a bug, want to improve the codebase, or have an idea for a new feature, this guide outlines how to get involved.


## Found a bug?

If the bug is a security vulnerability, do not open a public issue. Please report it privately, under our security policy.

Before opening an issue, please check the existing issues to make sure it has not already been reported.

If you cannot find an existing issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Include a clear title and description, relevant context, and a code sample or reproducible case that demonstrates the unexpected behavior.

Use a bug report template if available. Copy its content into a source file, modify it to reproduce the issue, and include the result in your issue description.


## Want to write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a pull request with your patch.

Ensure your pull request includes:

* A description of the problem
* An explanation of the solution
* A reference to the related issue, if applicable

Please follow the project's code style and verify that your changes pass all tests before submitting.

## Did you fix whitespace, reformat code, or make cosmetic changes?

Changes that are purely cosmetic and do not improve the clarity, functionality, or stability of the project are generally not accepted. This keeps the commit history focused and meaningful.


## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

Propose your idea to the community first and gather feedback before writing code. Only open a GitHub issue once there is consensus to move forward.

Changes that affect core behavior should be approached carefully. Avoid adding functionality that may conflict with future updates or platform standards.


## Have questions about the source code?

If you are unsure how something works or want guidance on contributing, feel free to ask the maintainers or start a discussion with the community.


## Wanted to contribute to the documentation?

Documentation contributions are welcome. Clear, accurate documentation helps users and contributors alike.
